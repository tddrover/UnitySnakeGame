# Unity Simple Snake Game

A c# game built in the Unity Engine. This is a classic snake game where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding obstacles.


Features
- Classic snake gameplay: Control the snake using WASD to eat apples and grow longer.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you eat food and grow the snake.
- Obstacles: Beware of obstacles like the poisoned apples or the wall that will end the game if the snake collides with them.
- Dynamic difficulty: As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging.

How to Play
- Use WASD to control the direction of the snake.
- Use Spacebar to pause the game, or unpause the game.
- Use the mouse to select menu options.
- Eat food (indicated by red squares) to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the poison apples (purple squares), the walls, or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle or itself.

Getting Started
- To play the game, simply download the project and open it in Unity. You can then build and run the game on your platform of choice.

- Sound effects, background music, and background art all from free asset packs on the Unity Asset Store.
- I used tutorials to get started on making this game since this is my first Unity Game, so not all my code is 100% my own.

- But I can say that the pause menus, main menu, game over screen, along with some other game elements are mostly my own, unlike the basic snake setup.
